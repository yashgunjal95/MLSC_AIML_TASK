**Oracle's Questions**:
1. "How many lectures did your soul actually attend this month?"
2. "Rate your procrastination from 'mild delay' to 'cosmic avoidance'?"

**Fortune**: 
*"The spirits whisper of academic resurrection! Your GPA shall rise like a phoenix... but only after it dramatically fails a group project where one member ghosts the entire team. Embrace the chaos, for through failure comes wisdom (and maybe a curve)."*

## How Generative AI is Used

This project uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model to:
- **Generate contextual questions** based on user-selected topics
- **Create personalized fortunes** that incorporate user responses
- **Maintain consistent personality** through system prompts

To demonstrate the functionality of the Oracle of Oddities, I have included a short video demonstration along with output screenshots inside the /demo folder. The video showcases the full workflow — selecting a topic, receiving the Oracle’s humorous follow-up questions, entering responses, and finally generating a personalized fortune. The screenshots provide additional visual proof of the application running end-to-end using generative AI. These assets serve as clear evidence of the project working as intended.
